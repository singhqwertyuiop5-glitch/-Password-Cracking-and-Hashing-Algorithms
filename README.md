# Password Cracking and Hashing Algorithms

## Objective
To understand how passwords are hashed, salted, and how weak passwords
can be cracked using brute-force and dictionary attacks in a controlled lab.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Hashcat
- John the Ripper

## Key Concepts
- Password Hashing
- Salting Techniques
- Brute Force Attacks
- Dictionary Attacks
- Cryptographic Weaknesses

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates why strong passwords and secure hashing
algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 are essential for system security.
